## OOC Notes

Character creation and discussion of character roles

Met with Teacher Ott who performed a series of questions to see how we thought and tried to learn a bit about who we are.
<br><br>

## In character notes

---

Everyone seems really fun, [[Hana]] called me a spirit and she's the only one who did... I like her

I was confused by [[Rogar]] he says he hasn't accomplished much, but his family has? I don't understand the difference, aren't they the same? I like him.

Whoa symbols just appeared out of thin air and we were instructed to choose one! I was very torn between the Balanced Scales and the Hourglass

## OOC Notes

---

[[NPC's/Students/Esi Djana]] is a fellow student showing us around. She seems very knowledgeable.

[[NPC's/Students/Chizire]] seems like a slacker who makes moonshine in his room. Called the moonshine wine at first and doesn't seem to know or care to know the difference. He's in the cascade bearers

[[NPC's/Students/Ignaci Canterells]] introduced himself and seems very well mannered.

[[NPC's/Students/Anchor Root]] is a very cautious person and quiet. Seems nervous when it comes to making friends and very much lacking in confidence.
<br><br>

## Entry

---

We have arrived at the academy and walked into the entryway, lots of people have greeted us so far, people here are so friendly. Chizire doesn't know the difference between moonshine and wine. I really like everyone so far they're all so friendly.

Esi knew I was a leshy, that's a magic school for you, they're all so proper.

I found a hatch

Found a black and white drawing of nethys. Quote on it: "All-Seeing Solutions: Pay in Light, Let the Darkness Show Wisdom!"

We were ambushed by some spell-work that thought we were intruders, they were just paper frogs. They can be re-united with the earth now.

It's a new day, I was fetched rather late. I rise with the sun. We have to look for some endangered Ojofiri Chickens or eggs. Need at least 4, at least one male and one female.

Ojofiri Chickens are described as

> small fowl with white faces, dark blue feathers, and lavender combs; chicks should have dark blue feathers with a white underbelly.
>
> The gather information activity was successful, Seydou may have what we need.

Still cold and dreary now, I was hoping it would burn off no time like the present for the market though! I think. We were able to find the chick's! Luckily there was male and a female, they're very fragile though. With help I was able to keep them very cuddled up and warm for the trip back because it was rainy. We were asked to remove some pugwampi gnolls from a storeroom in the town. The pugwampi have an obsessive love for gnolls, we were able to recruit Anchor Root to help us out as she's a gnoll. I got to meet anchor root, I'm supposed to treat her like the chicks, guess that means my quiet voice.

I finally got to meet Anchor Root, another friend, I like her.

They work for a big grimlin (Kershkin) and the big grimlin works for a scary ghost. The scary ghost and Kershkin are up to something that will be bad for the stuck up wizards

### Fireday, Rova 9th 4721 AR

We were approached by Ignaci and Strands-of-glowing-dawn (Tzeniwe). We were given elephant birds to ride, even for Oaky! Strands-of-glowing-dawn (Tzeniwe) seems to have set this up, thatâ€™s a mouthful to say. Tzeniwe said they represent the emerald bows.

Rogar has a mean side, he was scary when he told the mean lady that she needed to return the lamp. Everyone around was also not happy with what happened.

### Starday, Rova 10th 4721 AR

We have to collect a lot of things for Anchor Root.

### Moonday, Rova 12th 4721 AR

I really hit it off with Ignaci he seems to be warming up to me a little bit, especially after the Karen incident. I got to meet so many new people and learn about how they worship, it was my dream! I learned so much about Nantambu while interacting with the citizens and worshipers. Not only that but I heard so many fascinating things about the surrounding area and even far reaching areas, I cannot wait to explore these other areas. I'm also looking forward to learning even more about Ignaci

During this four month interval (Rova 12th - Kuthona 12th) Leafy started a compost pile for fertilizer for the flours he's going to plant in spring.
<br><br>

# Missed Sessions

## Missed notes...

I missed a ton of notes here...

## Branch

Leafy stuck with his primary focuses of Emerald Bows (primary) and Tempest-Sun Mages (secondary). He ultimately wants to make more friends and continue spreading happiness. His goal to adventure and defend his friends and family drives him to also be interested in the Tempest-Sun mages.

He was able to progress his main and sub branches a bit, but sometimes got a little too focused on his garden and arguing with the grounds keeper about how his plants helped balance the ecosystem and were critical to his mental health.

I got to the party a little late... [[Hana]], [[Rogar]], [[Ephret]] and [[Noct]] had already arrived. When I got here they were a little hurt :(. We had to spend a little time healing up and eventually we ran into our other friends [[Ignaci Canterells]] was hurt pretty bad...

We countered an enemy with a giant fly. She was being really mean to it knocking it down and whipping it...

- [[Giant Tsetse Fly]]
- [[Urbel]]

Well we managed to kill the giant fly, that was really rough... Unfortunately there is still the main guy left and I've used all my spells up... Hopefully my friends are in better shape than me.

Rogar almost went down, barely kept him up with my Battle Medicine...

We were able to beat them, but it took everything I had.

- [[Giant Tsetse Fly]]
- [[Urbel]]

We made our way to the north, we encountered a [[Gray Ooze]] that for now we're just avoiding, and also nearby some [[Brown Mold]] that reacts to heat. Rogar was able to fully remove it, but it did hurt a little...

A little beyond the brown mold we ran into some more creatures, and they sound mean... Oh another [[Giant Mining Bees]], ahead this is going to be rough. Also appear to be more of the [[Gnagrif]] grimlin guys, not sure what they are... They hurt so bad last time...

We're making our way to the [[Stone Ghost]] "office". Three masks and three cloaks are affixed to the south wall of this claustrophobic cave, as though in mockery of people, with arms extended to the sides. All look colorful, but dirty and bloodstained. One of the masks depicts a stern antelope, another a kindly hare, and the last a smiling warthog.

The masks look like masks from the magambia, they're [[Stone Ghost]] trophy's of other magambian's that have been here... This seems pretty ominous. One mask has magical properties. One of the masks has the ability to double healing when rolled, the other two Hanah put them in her backpack.

We found [[Stone Ghost]]s' room, just as I was feeling safe the ghost appeared. A voice rings out from the walls and it says "Attack these interloper's," he comes out of the wall and walked directly at [[Rogar]] just like a ghost.

### Combat Begins!!!

Well [[Stone Ghost]] wasn't so bad...  Hana was able to piece together all the notes, they have really complete maps of the tunnels.  Some of the older notes references [[Uduak Basni]] (maybe Stone Ghost's Name) and he's very happy about presence of the insects.  In addition there are details of attacks the first of which was the attack on our ceremony with each getting successively worse.
